When the course of civilization takes an unexpected turn—when, instead of the continuous progress which we have come to expect, we find ourselves threatened by evils associated by us with past ages of barbarism—we naturally blame anything but ourselves. Have we not all striven according to our best lights, and have not many of our finest minds incessantly worked to make this a better world? Have not all our efforts and hopes been directed toward greater freedom, justice, and prosperity? If the outcome is so different from our aims— if, instead of freedom and prosperity, bondage and misery stare us in the face—is it not clear that sinister forces must have foiled our intentions, that we are the victims of some evil power which must be conquered before we can resume the road to better things? However much we may differ when we name the culprit—whether it is the wicked capitalist or the vicious spirit of a particular nation, the stupidity of our elders, or a social system not yet,although we have struggled against it for half a century, fully overthrown—we all are, or at last were until recently, certain of one thing: that the leading ideas which during the last generation have become common to most people of good will and have determined the major changes in our social life cannot have been wrong. We are ready to accept almost any explanation of the present crisis of our civilization except one: that the present state of the world may be the result of genuine error on our own part and that the pursuit of some of our most cherished ideals has apparently produced results utterly different from those which we expected.

当文明的进程发生意外的转折时——当它并没有像我们所期待的那样持续进步，而我们却发现自己被与过去野蛮时代有关的邪恶所威胁时——我们自然而然地会抱怨除了自身以外的一切。我们不是都已经按照我们最好的愿景去努力了吗？我们中最优秀的头脑为使世界变得更好不是已经在不停工作了吗？我们所有的努力和希望不是都朝向更大的自由、正义和繁荣吗？倘若结果与我们的目标相差甚远——倘若我们实际上面临的不是自由和繁荣，而是奴役与穷困——那么显然，一定是有种险恶的势力挫败了我们的计划，我们是某种邪恶力量的受害者，在恢复这条康庄大道之前，我们必须击溃它，不是吗？对于该结果的罪魁祸首，无论我们对它的叫法有多么的不同——不管是某个邪恶的资本家，还是某一特别国家的某种恶毒的精神，或是我们先辈的愚蠢，抑或是还没有起作用的社会制度，我们尽管已经与它斗争了半个世纪，但还是完败了——我们始终都确信，或者直到最近才确信的一件事是：上一世代的指导思想在如今大多数善良的人中已普遍存在，并且已经在我们尚未走错的社会生活中起主导作用。我们已经接受了我们文明现存危机的几乎一切的解释，除了这条以外：可能是我们自己的真正的错误造成了世界的现状，我们对某些最宝贵的理想的追求，明显产生了与我们预期完全不符的结果。

While all our energies are directed to bring this war to a victorious conclusion, it is sometimes difficult to remember that even before the war the values for which we are now fighting were threatened here and destroyed elsewhere. Though for the time being the different ideals are represented by hostile nations fighting for their existence, we must not forget that this conflict has grown out of a struggle of ideas within what,not so long ago,was a common European civilization and that the tendencies which have culminated in the creation of the totalitarian systems were not confined to the countries which have succumbed to them. Though the first task must now be to win the war, to win it will only gain us another opportunity to face the basic problems and to find a way of averting the fate which has overtaken kindred civilizations.

Now, it is somewhat difficult to think of Germany and Italy, or of Russia,not as different worlds but as products of a development of thought in which we have shared; it is, at least so far as our enemies are concerned,easier and more comforting to think that they are entirely different from us and that what happened there cannot happen here. Yet the history of these countries in the years before the rise of the totalitarian system showed few features with which we are not familiar. The external conflict is a result of a transformation of European thought in which others have moved so much faster as to bring them into irreconcilable conflict with our ideals, but which has not left us unaffected.

That a change of ideas and the force of human will have made the world what it is now, though men did not foresee the results, and that no spontaneous change in the facts obliged us thus to adapt our thought is perhaps particularly difficult for the Anglo-Saxon nations to see, just because in this development they have, fortunately for them, lagged behind most of the European peoples.We still think of the ideals which guide us, and have guided us for the past generation, as ideals only to be realized in the future and are not aware how far in the last twenty-five years they have already transformed not only the world but also our own countries. We still believe that until quite recently we were governed by what are vaguely called nineteenth-century ideas or the principle of laissez faire. Compared with some other countries, and from the point of view of those impatient to speed up the change, there may be some justification for such belief. But although until 1931 England and America had followed only slowly on the path on which others had led, even by then they had moved so far that only those whose memory goes back to the years before the last war know what a liberal world has been like.
