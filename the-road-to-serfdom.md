When the course of civilization takes an unexpected turn—when, instead of the continuous progress which we have come to expect, we find ourselves threatened by evils associated by us with past ages of barbarism—we naturally blame anything but ourselves. Have we not all striven according to our best lights, and have not many of our finest minds incessantly worked to make this a better world? Have not all our efforts and hopes been directed toward greater freedom, justice, and prosperity? If the outcome is so different from our aims— if, instead of freedom and prosperity, bondage and misery stare us in the face—is it not clear that sinister forces must have foiled our intentions, that we are the victims of some evil power which must be conquered before we can resume the road to better things? However much we may differ when we name the culprit—whether it is the wicked capitalist or the vicious spirit of a particular nation, the stupidity of our elders, or a social system not yet,although we have struggled against it for half a century, fully overthrown—we all are, or at last were until recently, certain of one thing: that the leading ideas which during the last generation have become common to most people of good will and have determined the major changes in our social life cannot have been wrong. We are ready to accept almost any explanation of the present crisis of our civilization except one: that the present state of the world may be the result of genuine error on our own part and that the pursuit of some of our most cherished ideals has apparently produced results utterly different from those which we expected.

当文明的进程发生意外的转折时——当它并没有像我们所期待的那样持续进步，而我们发现自己被与自身联系的邪恶和过去的野蛮所胁迫时——我们自然而然地会抱怨除了自身以外的一切。我们不是都已经按照我们最好的愿景去努力了吗？我们中最优秀的头脑为使世界变得更好不是已经在不停工作了吗？我们所有的努力和希望不是都朝向更大的自由、正义和繁荣吗？若结果与我们的目标相差甚远——若实际上我们面临的不是自由和繁荣，而是奴役与穷困——显然，一定有种险恶的势力挫败了我们的意图，我们是某种邪恶力量的受害者，在恢复这条康庄大道前，我们必须击溃它，不是吗？无论我们对该罪魁祸首的称呼有多么的不同——不管它是某个邪恶的资本家，还是某一特定国家的某种恶毒的精神，或是我们先辈的愚蠢，抑或是还没有起作用的社会制度，我们尽管已经与它斗争了半个世纪，但还是完败了——我们始终都确信，或者说直到最近才确信的一件事是：
